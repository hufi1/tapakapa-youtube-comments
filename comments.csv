"UgwvvBGg3tOtyoarLkp4AaABAg","Jinx Dragon","Point of note: 
The prisoners where over-flowing so they could ship people to colonies, a form of 'slavery-lite.'

While I highly recommend reading about the Somersett's Case, losing access to slavery while expanding colonies was a problem for England.  The government solved this by making some very... questionable... laws that could be used to round up and deport a bunch of warm bodies to any colony.   Even though they where not technically slaves, once in Australia they would be stuck working some squatters land for a pittance.   Such an English solution to poverty and slavery if there ever was one....","1","true","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HKY_eAiqkY&lc=UgwvvBGg3tOtyoarLkp4AaABAg","2018-07-27 22:36:43","0"

"Ugxjwf3fAZLFEPRFGd14AaABAg","Erik Žiak","Fun fact: Austria is being called ""Rakúsko""/""Rakousko"" in Slovak/Czech. How come? The name previously known as ""Rakúsy"" and later ""Rakousy"", originates in the name of the Austrian castle and town of Raabs an der Thaya near the current Czech-Austrian border, formerly also known as Ratgoz or Ratgos. So the people near it as well as to the south of it were called accordingly. It is worth noting that the ancient writer Ptolemy mentions two tribes named Racatae and Racatriae which inhabit the areas around the Danube River ""up to his bend"", roughly corresponding to the region north of Vienna and southwestern Slovakia.

"UgxpU70VUOwER_gtET54AaABAg","camfunme","3:01 this is not accurate. 

In 1644 maps displayed the name Hollandia Nova over the mapped Western two thirds of the continent, i.e. everything West of the 135th degree East meridian, they also displayed the name Terra Australis in what is now the Coral Sea to denote the unmapped region believing there to still be an unfound continent.

In 1770 Captain (then Leiutenant) Cook mapped the Eastern third of the continent, New Zealand and many small islands, under directives to find the missing ""Southern Continent"". He sent letters back to the British Admiralty suggesting to claim the Eastern third and call it New South Wales, which they did in 1788. Their claim was built upon the 1494 Treaty of Tordesillas splitting Spanish and Portuguese colonial territory by the 135th degree East meridian.


In 1803 Matthew Flinders circumnavigated the continent and named the fully mapped continent as Australia, though the first part of the continent to adopt this name wasn't until the rebranding of the Swan River Colony in 1832.","3","true","https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_HKY_eAiqkY&lc=UgxpU70VUOwER_gtET54AaABAg","2019-12-20 11:52:41","1"
